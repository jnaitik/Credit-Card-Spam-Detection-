# 💳 Credit Card Spam Detection

This is a simple machine learning project made as part of a hackathon under the AI/ML theme. The goal is to detect whether a credit card transaction is spam (fraud) or not. I’ve built a small web app using Flask for the backend and HTML/CSS/JavaScript for the front end.

- `train_model.py` – Trains the machine learning model on the dataset
- `credit_card_synthetic.csv` – A synthetic dataset used to train the model
- `index.html` – Home page of the web app
- `dashboard.html` – Dashboard page to show results or overview
- `guide.html` – Simple user guide or instruction page
- `script.js` and `dashboard.js` – Frontend JavaScript files for extra features
- `styles.css` – Basic styling for the website
